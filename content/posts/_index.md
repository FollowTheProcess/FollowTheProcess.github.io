Below you'll find some of the stuff I've written about. These could be things I discovered whilst learning that maybe took me far too long to find, had a high entry barrier, or were an otherwise tricky hurdle for a beginner to get past.

Or just interesting thoughts or ideas related to science, engineering, programming, learning, or anything else I can think of.

Or just things I think are useful :nerd_face:
