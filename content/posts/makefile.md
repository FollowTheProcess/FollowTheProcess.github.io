If you aren't familiar with [make], it's a command runner and build system capable of quite complicated stuff. It's syntax can get complicated for non-trivial workflows and it has lots of weird quirks (like `.PHONY`).

However, it's ubiquitous on nearly all systems and pretty easy to get going with so it's very widely used in all sorts of projects in just about every language.

In fact, a filename global search on GitHub yields an astonishing 112 million results!

Despite this, most Makefiles I've come across in the wild have been poorly documented and not very user friendly! We can fix this with a bit of shell trickery ðŸ˜‰

So here it is, the self-documenting Makefile:

```makefile
.DEFAULT_GOAL := help
.PHONY: help start build clean colors
SHELL=/usr/bin/env zsh

# Define standard colors
ifneq (,$(findstring xterm,${TERM}))
    BLACK        := $(shell tput -Txterm setaf 0)
    RED          := $(shell tput -Txterm setaf 1)
    GREEN        := $(shell tput -Txterm setaf 2)
    YELLOW       := $(shell tput -Txterm setaf 3)
    LIGHTPURPLE  := $(shell tput -Txterm setaf 4)
    PURPLE       := $(shell tput -Txterm setaf 5)
    BLUE         := $(shell tput -Txterm setaf 6)
    WHITE        := $(shell tput -Txterm setaf 7)
    RESET    := $(shell tput -Txterm sgr0)
else
    BLACK        := ""
    RED          := ""
    GREEN        := ""
    YELLOW       := ""
    LIGHTPURPLE  := ""
    PURPLE       := ""
    BLUE         := ""
    WHITE        := ""
    RESET        := ""
endif

# Set target color
TARGET_COLOR := $(BLUE)

colors: ## Show all the colors
    @echo "${BLACK}BLACK${RESET}"
    @echo "${RED}RED${RESET}"
    @echo "${GREEN}GREEN${RESET}"
    @echo "${YELLOW}YELLOW${RESET}"
    @echo "${LIGHTPURPLE}LIGHTPURPLE${RESET}"
    @echo "${PURPLE}PURPLE${RESET}"
    @echo "${BLUE}BLUE${RESET}"
    @echo "${WHITE}WHITE${RESET}"

help: ## Show the list of available tasks
    @echo "${GREEN}Available Tasks: ${RESET}"
    @echo "${WHITE}-----------------------------------------------------------------${RESET}\n"
    @grep -E '^[a-zA-Z_0-9%-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "${TARGET_COLOR}%-10s${RESET} %s\n", $$1, $$2}'


build: ## Build some things
    @echo "building"

start: ## Start some service
    docker compose up

clean: ## Remove unused clutter
    rm -rf ./cache
```

And now because we set `.DEFAULT_GOAL` to `help`, when we run `make` we get a very pretty help message!
