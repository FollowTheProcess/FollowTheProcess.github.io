# About

Hi!

You've somehow stumbled on my page! I'm treating this as a step further than the profile README and a bit less rubbish than linkedin :hand_over_mouth:.

I'm Tom, and I'm currently in the process of turning a career in engineering (the old fashioned mechanical kind) into one where I get the computer to do all the work like automating everything in sight, doing fancy statistics, making tasty graphs, analysing data that would make excel explode, machine learning, APIs and just generally levelling up my nerd score.

I've spent the past year or so teaching myself computer science, python, bash, SQL, Go, API's, Docker, CI/CD, TDD and a host of other stuff (not javascript though :nauseated_face:).

This site serves as equal parts CV, a nicer overview of my projects than just a README, and a place to put anything I discover along the way that I think needs sharing (the word blog makes me cringe a little bit...).

# Projects

Below you'll find a list of some of the projects I've built.

There is a mix of:

* OSS packages
* Data Analysis/Visualisation projects
* Automation
* ML projects
* etc.
