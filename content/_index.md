## About

Hi!

*You've somehow stumbled on my page! I'm treating this as a step further than the profile README and a bit less rubbish than linkedin* :hand_over_mouth:. *Here you'll find some of my projects and interesting thoughts or useful tips and tricks to do with programming/data.*

I'm Tom, my background is in aerospace engineering and materials science but I'm learning how to get the computer to do all the work one step at a time by:

* automating everything in sight
* doing fancy statistics
* making tasty graphs
* analysing data that would make excel explode
* machine learning
* APIs

And just generally levelling up my overall nerd score.

I've spent the past year or so teaching myself computer science, python, bash, SQL, Go, API's, Docker, CI/CD, TDD and a host of other stuff (not javascript though :nauseated_face:).

## Projects

Below you'll find a list of some of the projects I've built.

There is a mix of:

* OSS packages
* Data Analysis/Visualisation
* Automation
* ML
