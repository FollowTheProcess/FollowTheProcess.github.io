      <description>pymechtest is a small, hopefully helpful python package to help engineers collate, process, analyse, and report on mechanical test data. I built pymechtest to help automate the things I did on a near-daily basis as a materials engineer. I hope it can prove some use to you too!
  Source Code: https://github.com/FollowTheProcess/pymechtest
  Documentation: https://FollowTheProcess.github.io/pymechtest/
