Achieved a damage severity predicive accuracy of ±0.25mm and a positional predictive accuracy of ±7.0mm.

Background Repeated cyclic loading of a material will eventually lead to a phenomenon called &amp;ldquo;fatigue crack growth&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to explain the details here but I&amp;rsquo;d point you to this for more info. Essentially, a crack will start to form and repeated cyclic loading will progressively grow this crack until it is large enough such that the remaining material can no longer handle the stress and the component will break.</description></item></channel></rss>
