&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s mainly poking fun at the kinds of ways you can get your installation all screwed up if you&amp;rsquo;re not careful but is often misinterpreted as throwing shade on how python works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://snarky.ca/deconstructing-xkcd-com-1987/">Brett Cannon&amp;rsquo;s Blog Post&lt;/a> has an excellent deconstruction of what this xkcd means and how to avoid it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s lots you can do to avoid this happening to you.

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve not had the joy of running into this particular error: &lt;a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15947">https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15947&lt;/a> I don&amp;rsquo;t envy you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot of information on the GitHub issue thread about it and on stack overflow etc and honestly you should look at that for a better explanation, those people know far more than me! There&amp;rsquo;s lots of informed discussion on exactly &lt;em>why&lt;/em> this error is raised which I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
